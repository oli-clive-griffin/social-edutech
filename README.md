A community and collaboration oriented platform for online learning.


### Current problems with online education:

- Lonely and aimless
- Unstructured
- Unguided

### The Goal 

I want to create a learning platform that is community-first. It will be a way to connnect with like-minded people, collaborate on projects, and help each other learn.
